This project implements a robust relational database schema for an e-commerce platform. Designed for scalability and flexibility, the database efficiently handles product management, inventory tracking, and complex product variations.

## Data Flow 

#### Product Setup:

Add to product → Assign brand/category → Upload product_images

#### Variations:

Define allowed color/size option via product_variation

#### Inventory:

Create product_item entries for each variation (SKU, stock, price)

#### Attributes:

Add specs via product_attribute → Grouped by attribute_category

## Tools Used
